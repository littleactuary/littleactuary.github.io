### 1.1. Risk and Return of a Single Asset

Consider a single asset with return R (a random variable following a discrete distribution : \\( \forall i = 1, ..., n: P(R=R_i) = p_i  \\). We are interested in calculating the mean and variance of its return (also called risk in this case) : 

\\[ E[R]=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i*R_i} \\] 
\\[ Var(R)= E[(R_i-E[R])^2] =\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i(R_i-E[R])^2} = E[R^2]-(E[R])^2 \\]

The standard deviation of R is : \\( SD(R)=\sqrt{Var(R)} \\)

Now the question is, how do we define the return R for an asset ? 
Let's consider an asset (an equity for example) with price \\( P_t \\) at time \\( t \\) and \\( P_{t+1} \\) at time \\( t+1 \\). In addition, this asset pays a dividend \\( D_{t+1} \\) between \\( t \\) and \\( t+1 \\). Its realiaed return in the interval \\( [t, t+1] \\) is then the sum of capital gain and the dividend yield :
\\[ R_{t+1} = frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t} + frac{D_{t+1}}{P_t} \\]
