## 1. Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory

### 1.a. Risk and Return of a Single Asset

Consider a single asset with return R (a random variable following a discrete distribution : \\( \forall i = 1, ..., n: P(R=R_i) = p_i  \\). We are interested in calculating the mean and variance of its return (the variance of return is considered as the measure of risk in this framework) :
\\[ E[R] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_iR_i} \\]
\\[ Var(R)= E[(R_i-E[R])^2] =\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i(R_i-E[R])^2} = E[R^2]-(E[R])^2 \\]
The standard deviation of R is : \\( SD(R)=\sqrt{Var(R)} \\)

Now the question is, how do we define the (rate of) return R for an asset ?
Let's consider an asset (an equity for example) with price \\( P_t \\) at time \\( t \\) and \\( P_{t+1} \\) at time \\( t+1 \\). In addition, this asset pays a dividend \\( D_{t+1} \\) between \\( t \\) and \\( t+1 \\). Its realized return in the interval \\( [t, t+1] \\) is then the sum of capital gain and the dividend yield :
\\[ R_{t+1} = \frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t} + \frac{D_{t+1}}{P_t} \\]

In practice, the rate of return can be calculated on a daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, depending on the type of asset. one can easily convert the rate of return between these different time intervals (or basis). For example, an annual realized return can be deducted from the four quarterly returns :
\\[ 1 + R_{t+1} = (1+R_{Q1})...(1+R_{Q4}) \\]

The return of an asset may vary from a given year to another, depending on its performance. One can be interested in the mean of all annual return, called  average annual return, for a period of T years :
\\[ \overline{R} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t \\]
Once again, the "risk" can be measured by the variance :
\\[ Var(R) = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (R_t- \overline{R})^2 \\]

The standard error corresponds to the standard deviation divided by the number of observations :
\\[ SE(R) = \frac{SD(R)}{\sqrt{nb.obs}} \\]
with \\( nb.obs = T \\) in our example.
The 95% confidence interval for the expected return is :
\\[ \left[ \overline{R} - 2 \frac{SD(R)}{\sqrt{nb.obs}} ; \overline{R} + 2 \frac{SD(R)}{\sqrt{nb.obs}} \right] \\]

### 1.b. Risk and Return of a Portfolio
Once we know how to measure the risk a and return of an asset, we can extend the calculation to a portfolio of assets/investments, by recognizing that the return of a portfolio is simply the weighted sum of return of each asset in it.
\\[ R_p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iR_i  \\]
with \\(x_i = \frac{\large{\text{value of asset i}}}{\large{\text{total value of portfolio}}}, i = 1, ..., n \\)    (Note that \\( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1 \\)).

The mean (expectation) of the portfolio's return is:
\\[ E[R_p] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iE[R_i]  \\]
The variance of the portfolio's return is :
\\[ Var(R_p) = \sigma^2_p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i Cov(R_i, R_p) =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_i x_j Cov(R_i, R_j)  \\]

Note that one can also compute the latter term (the covariance of each investment/asset's return) as follows :
\\[ Cov(R_i, R_j) = E[ ( R_i - E[R_i] )(R_j - E[R_j])] =  \rho_{i,j} \sigma_i \sigma_j \\]
Again, given the returns of i and j over a period of T (years), we can estimate their covariance by:
\\[ \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (R_{i,t} - \overline{R_i}) (R_{j,t} - \overline{R_j}) \\]
