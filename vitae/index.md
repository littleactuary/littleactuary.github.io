From 2014 to 2015, I worked, as a trainee actuary, in non-life insurance and reinsurance for different AXA's entities (AXA France, AXA Corporate Solutions, AXA Global P&C). I joined EY in late 2015, doing consulting and audit activities for major European insurance groups, and specializing myself on Solvency II and Asset Liability Management (ALM) subjects. From 2018, I'm responsible of ALM, statistical/actuarial modeling for the french mutual insurance group Covéa.

## Professional Experience

*From Jan 2018* **Responsible of statistical & actuarial modeling at Covéa (Investment Department)**

* I'm in charge of ALM modeling and Solvency II for the 3 Life insurance entities of Covéa : MMA Vie SA, GMF Vie SA and MAAF Vie SA.
* I analyse the impacts of Investment policies and Profit Sharing policies of the group on SII indicators and profitability metrics.
* I conduct studies on Analysis of Change in BE (VA C2C) and Own Funds SII


-----

*Dec 2015 - Dec 2017* **Actuarial Consultant at EY**

* Being part of the Life-Insurance team, I helped major insurance groups integrate Solvency II framework (ALM model review & development, quarter & annual calculation of BE, SCR and solvency ratio, VA C2C analysis, ORSA, strategic asset allocation, etc.).
* I'd worked tightly with third-party ALM software editors in developing, maintaining and integrating their products into our clients systems.
* I'd also developed internal tools, as add-ins for third-party softwares or stand-alone applications, responding to our clients' needs (process automatization & optimization, analysis & backtesting tools).

*June 2014 - Oct 2015* **Trainee actuary at different entities of AXA group**

AXA Corporate Solutions (Model, Reserving & Reinsurance team)

* My main mission was to develop an actuarial model for Major Losses Reserving at AXA CS. In this model, the Major Losses Threshold is determined according to some techniques derived from the Extreme Values Theory. Once this threshold is calibrated, the model will separately estimate  the IBNeR amounts (using an individual method that I named Individual Chain-ladder) and the IBNyR amounts (thanks to a frequency-severity approach and an aggregated method).
* I deployed a corresponding desktop application (with R and Shiny package). [Here is a post of mine about deploying a user-friendly desktop application with R, Shiny, and a web browser.]({{ site.url }}/blog/Web-application-framework-with-Shiny/){:target="_blank"}
* I also participated to the 3rd quarter reserving (Q3) and forecasting (F3) process.


AXA Global P&C (Reinsurance team)

* I was in charge of improving and speeding-up a CAT/Atypical modeling & reinsurance pricing tool (with R/C++ thanks to Rcpp package).[Here's a post of mine about how to speed-up R programs with Rcpp package in R]({{ site.url }}/blog/connecting-R-and-Cpp-with-Rcpp/){:target="_blank"}.
* I also helped restructure the program, added new functionalities and prepared the integration of the R core into a web platform.


AXA Solutions Collectives (Health insurance team)

* The main mission was to calibrate different dental claim distributions (with SAS) and then to deploy a tool for measuring the pricing impact of a dental cap (with Excel/VBA).

* I also conducted a study of the senior policyholders' behaviors on health insurance consumption before their retirement.
