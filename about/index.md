### About this blog

## Purpose

I've created this blog as my personal portfolio, to store some of my projects and to share my experience in Actuarial and Data Science fields. I'm not a professional in these fields and this blog is not a technical ressource. Most of my posts aim to give a simple, comprenhensive overview about some particular subjects.  

## About Jekyll

This blog is created with [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [**GitHub**](https://github.com). 
I use **So Simple Theme** created by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com). For those who are interrested in blogging (like me), here's some facts about Jekyll and the reasons for what I've chosen Jekyll.
