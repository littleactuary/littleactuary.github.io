### About Me

My name's Duc-Hien. I'm from Hanoi, Vietnam. I moved in Paris in 2009 to study and I've been living here since. I hold a MSc degree in Statistics (Actuarial Science Major) at [**ENSAE ParisTech**](http://www.ensae.fr). Felow Actuary, I'm currently working as a Actuarial Consultant. I spend my free time to learn Data Science and Programming (R, Python, web technologies).

### About this blog

I've created this blog as my personal portfolio, to store some of my projects and to share my experience in Actuarial and Data Science fields. I'm not a professional in these fields and this blog is thus not a technical ressource. Most of my posts aim to give a simple, comprenhensive overview about some particular subjects.
