## About Me

Hi, my name's Duc Hien and I'm from Vietnam. I moved to France in 2009 to pursue my higher studies and I've been living here since then. I hold a MSc degree in Statistics (Actuarial Science Major) at ENSAE ParisTech. Associated actuary of the Institute of French Actuaries, Institut des Actuaires (IA), I'm pursuing my fellowship at the Society of Actuary (SOA).I work as an ALM actuary at Covéa. I'm interested in Actuarial Science (of course), Financial mathematics, Computer Science and Web development (a little bit). I still cannot pick one as my favorite one. So, I keep learning them all..., very slowly.

## About this blog

I use this blog to keep track of my progress on Actuarial Science learning (sometimes finance and IT too). I'm not an expert in any of these fields and I just want to take note of what I learn and share it online. It is the best way for me to better understand and to remember things, also to learn from your comments.
