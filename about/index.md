## About this blog

I've created this blog as my personal portfolio, to store some of my academic/professional projects and to share my experience in Actuarial and Data Science fields. I'm not an expert in these fields and this blog is not a technical ressource. Most of my posts aim to give a simple, comprenhensive overview about some particular subjects.  

This blog is powered by [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com), using **So Simple Theme** created by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com), and hosted on [**GitHub**](https://github.com). For those who are interrested in blogging (like me), [here's some facts about Jekyll and the reasons for what I've chosen Jekyll]({{ site.url }}/blog/2014-08-08-blogging-like-a-ninja)
