## About this blog

I created this blog to keep track of my progress on Actuarial Science and Data Science learning. I'm not an expert in any of these fields and this blog is definitely not a technical ressource. Most of my posts aim to give a simple overview about some particular subjects that I have dealt with. 

You may wonder why the title of this blog is Little Actuary. In fact, Big Data is now such a big deal and like many other people who are intereted in this phenomenon, I'm trying to understand a part of it and to figure out a way to apply Big Data in my work. So, I consider myself as a little actuary in the big world of data.
