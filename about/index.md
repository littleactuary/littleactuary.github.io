## About Me

Hi, my name's Duc Hien. I'm from Vietnam. I moved to Paris in 2009 to pursue my higher studies and I've been living here since then. I hold a MSc degree in Statistics (Actuarial Science Major) at ENSAE ParisTech. Associated actuary of the Institue of Actuaries (IA), I currently work as an Actuarial Consultant. I'm interested in Actuarial Science (of course), Computer Science, Data Science (in progress) and Web development (a little bit).

## About this blog

I created this blog to keep track of my progress on Actuarial Science and Data Science learning. I'm not an expert in any of these fields and this blog is definitely not a technical ressource. I just want to take note of what I learn. It is the best way for me to understand and to remember things. 

You may wonder why the title of this blog is Little Actuary. In fact, Big Data is now such a big deal and like many other people who are intereted in this phenomenon, I'm trying to understand a part of it and to figure out a way to apply Big Data in my work. So, I consider myself as a little actuary in the big world of data.
