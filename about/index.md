## About Me

Hi, my name's Duc Hien and I'm from Vietnam. I moved to France in 2009 to pursue my higher studies and I've been living here since then. I hold a MSc degree in Statistics (Actuarial Science Major) at  [**ENSAE Paris**](https://www.ensae.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}. Associate actuary of the [**Institut des Actuaires (IA)**](https://www.institutdesactuaires.com){:target="_blank"}, I'm currently pursuing the fellowship pathway of the [**Society of Actuary (SOA)**](https://www.soa.org){:target="_blank"}. 

I work as an ALM actuary for the french mutual insurance group [**Covéa**](https://www.covea.eu/en/home/){:target="_blank"}. 

I love Mathematics and more specifically Financial Mathematics. I also enjoy learning programming and web development on my free time.

## About this blog

I use this blog to keep track of my progress on Actuarial Science and Finance learning, by taking note of what I've learned and sharing it online. It is the best way for me to better understand and to remember things. I also hope to learn more from your comments.
