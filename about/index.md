## About this blog

This blog is my personal portfolio, to store some of my academic projects and to share my professional experience in Actuarial and Data Science. I'm not an expert in any of these fields and this blog is definitely not a technical ressource. Most of my posts aim to give a simple, comprenhensive overview about some particular subjects that I have dealt with.  

You may wonder why the title of this blog is Little Actuary. In fact, Big Data is now such a big deal and like many others who are intereted in this phenomenon, I'm trying to understand a part of it and to figure out a way to apply Big Data in my work. So, I consider myself as a Little Actuary in the Big Data world.
