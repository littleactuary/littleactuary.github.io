## About Me

Hi, my name is Duc Hien and I'm from Vietnam. I moved to France in 2009 to pursue my higher studies and I've been living here since then.


I'm an actuary and I'm interested in Mathematics, Finance and Artificial Intelligence . I also enjoy learning programming and web development on my free time.

## About this blog

I use this blog to keep track of my progress on Actuarial Science and Finance learning, by taking note of what I've learned and sharing it online. It is the best way for me to better understand and to remember things. I also hope to learn more from your comments.
